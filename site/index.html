            <p>Hi! My name is Camila and I'm making this website to practice HTML and CSS. I'm learning from Youtube videos and courses so I decided to
            gather everything here. I'm also using twitter bootstrap, so you can appreciate this website form any device (I hope).</p>
            <p>Since I've watched so many tv shows and I'm really into them, this is the topic I'm choosing to talk about here. 
            I'm making my top 6 favourite tv shows of all time and at the end I bring up some special mentions. I explain what are they about,
            what I value the most about them and I link a youtube video with the trailer or a special scene from the show.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and when you're not sure what to watch next... remember my recommendations! </p>

        <h3 class="by">Prime Video</h3>
        <div>
            <p> Witten and starred by the amazing Phoebe Waller Bridge is probably the funniest tv show I've seen.
                It´s the story of Fleabag, a woman living in London and dealing with a recent tragedy, life, family, love and work.
                The lack of filters and being hilarious while covering mundane topics is what made it my favourite show of all time.
                And it´s always great. Every episode.
            </p>

                E-Corp but not everything is what it seems. It messes with your mind and you rech a point where you no longer know
                what's real and what's not. Also, the photography is beautiful and Rami Malek is an amazing actor.</p>

        <div>
            <p> You have probably heard a lot about Game of Thrones and how geat it is... well, it's all true. This tv show is something else.
                I've alse read the books and they are even better. Something I love about it is that the characters are not good or evil, they're something in the middle,
                they always suprise you. And the whole world, the history created to bring Westeros to life is just perfect. </p>
            <p> There are a lot of epic episodes and scenes, I'm gonna leave you with

        <h3 class="by">Prime Video</h3>
        <div>
            <p> The 50's. Marketing. An excesive amount of smoking. This is Mad Men. Every character gets its own amazing development, and the actors, Jon Hamm, John Slattery,
                January Jones, Elisabeth Moss, Christina Hendriks, to name the main ones, are brilliant. The atmosphere is on point,
                the historical events are not a plus, they are part of the plot and I don't think I have seen a show that does that as good as Mad Men.
                I thought it wouldn't keep being that good for seven seasons, but it did. Outstanding from begining to end.

        <h3 class="by">Netflix</h3>
        <div>
            <p> A musical made it to the top 5, and I'm not even a fan of musicals so yes, it is THAT good. Rebecca is absolutely crazy, she moves
                across the country to be with her ex boyfriend from when they were sixteen. Soon, she meets her coworker and accomplice Paula and they 
                both have one goal: get Josh to fall in love with Rebecca. Everything that happens is hilarious and the songs are exceptional, and ironic most of the time.

            <p> Arcane is an animated show based on League of Legends, but it doesn't matter if you haven't played LoL, I really recommend it to everyone.
                The animations are wonderful, and you'll fall in love with the characters. Can't wait for season two, which has already been confirmed.
